# 🎙️ Voice AI Assistant Website

A **web-based Voice AI Assistant** that enables users to interact with the system using **speech recognition and voice commands**. The project combines frontend web technologies with AI-driven voice processing to deliver a hands-free, conversational user experience.

This repository demonstrates how **Voice AI**, **web interfaces**, and **backend logic** can be integrated into a practical assistant-style application.
